# Current state of the World

Here is a file that lays out the basics for the current state of the randomizer

## Settings

There is only 1 new setting. Force reload controls weither the game will reload upon recieving a Progressive Shard.
Deathlink will only kill the player in a run.

## Client

The client is limited on the player side. Currently there is no message log in game. The text client is reccomended to work around this.

# Message

Thank you all for spending the time to enjoy this.

If you could star this repo that would mean a lot to me, I like numbers to go up.

If you feel something is wrong with this file let me know so I can fix it. If it is wrong here then its is highly likely that I don't know about it.
